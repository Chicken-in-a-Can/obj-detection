# Onject Detection
**TensorFlow** object detection for roboboat  
Set up for squares and circles on notecards, because I don't have a pool to fit buoys in  
Core count is limited because our main unit has limited resources  
I included the model creation python file for future members of the club to use, or if I suck at creating object detection models  
*I had to add a **lot** of swap to do this*

## What it currently does
It detects the position and type of show objects  
Supported objects are as follows:  
  - Green circle
  - Green square
  - Orange circle
  - Orange square
